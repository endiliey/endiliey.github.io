## Introduction

<img src="https://docusaurus.io/img/slash-introducing.svg" alt="Docusaurus"/>

Docusaurus is not just a documentation site generator. It is a **painless static site generator** with focus on *content-centric website like documentation and blog site*.

This website for example, is build with Docusaurus 2 alpha.

## Features

- ‚öõÔ∏è **Built using React** Extend or customize with React.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Blazing Fast** Link prefetching, instant navigation and page views
- ‚úÇÔ∏è **Easy** Hot Reloadable out-of-the-box, automatic code and data splitting!
- üí• **Single-page application** Add dynamic interactivity to your website
- üéØ **SEO Friendly** files are staticly generated (SSR)
- üòå **Painless** Painless project setup. First class support for documentation
- üìù **[MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) Based.** Write markdown enhanced by the power of components.
- üöÄ **many others** ....

## üí° Getting Started

Ok, you're ready for action. At this moment of writing, **`docusaurus init`** command hasn't been implemented for Docusaurus v2 yet, so we'll have to create files manually for now.

```bash
mkdir website
cd website
yarn init
```

Install dependencies
```bash
yarn add react react-dom @docusaurus/core@next @docusaurus/preset-classic@next
```

Then, add some scripts to `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "docusaurus start",
  "build": "docusaurus build",
  "swizzle": "docusaurus swizzle",
  "deploy": "docusaurus deploy"
},
```

Create `docusaurus.config.js` with the content below:

```js
const siteConfig = {
  title: "Docusaurus",
  tagline: "Super awesome site",
  url: "https://docusaurus.io",
  baseUrl: "/",
  projectName: "docusaurus",
  organizationName: "facebook",
  themeConfig: {
    headerLinks: [
      { url: "docs/hello", label: "Docs" },
      { url: "blog", label: "Blog" }
    ],
    footer: {
      style: 'dark',
      links: [
        {
          title: 'Docs',
          items: [
            {
              label: 'Hello',
              to: 'docs/hello',
            },
          ],
        },
        {
          title: 'Community',
          items: [
            {
              label: 'Discord',
              href: 'https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus',
            },
          ],
        },
        {
          title: 'Social',
          items: [
            {
              label: 'Blog',
              to: 'blog',
            }
          ],
        },
      ],
      logo: {
        alt: 'Facebook Open Source Logo',
        src: 'https://docusaurus.io/img/oss_logo.png',
      },
      copyright: `Copyright ¬© ${new Date().getFullYear()} Facebook, Inc.`,
    },
  },
  headerIcon: "",
  favicon: "",
  presets: [
    [
      "@docusaurus/preset-classic"
    ]
  ]
};

module.exports = siteConfig;
```

Let's create three directories. `pages`, `docs` and `blog`.

```md
‚îú‚îÄ docs
‚îú‚îÄ blog
‚îú‚îÄ pages
‚îî‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ docusaurus.config.js
```

## Pages

Let's begin by creating our homepage. 

We'll create **`pages/index.css`**

```css
/* pages/index.css */
.App {
  text-align: center;
}

.App-logo {
  animation: App-logo-spin infinite 20s linear;
  height: 40vmin;
  pointer-events: none;
}

.App-header {
  min-height: 50vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  font-size: calc(10px + 2vmin);
  color: black;
}

@keyframes App-logo-spin {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
```

And the javascript file itself **`pages/index.js`**

```js
// pages/index.js
import React from "react";
import Layout from "@theme/Layout";
import "./index.css";

function Home() {
  return (
    <Layout title="Hello">
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img
            src={"https://forum.endiliey.com/static/media/logo.5d5d9eef.svg"}
            className="App-logo"
            alt="logo"
          />
          <p>
            Edit <code>pages/index.js</code> and save to reload.
          </p>
        </header>
      </div>
    </Layout>
  );
}

export default Home;
```

Then, let's run the development server
```bash
yarn start # open up http://localhost:3000
```

![Hello World](/img/hello-world.PNG)

You should see a page like this. The key idea is to just write **`React`** component as pages. For example,if you create a new file **`pages/hello.js`**, it will be available at http://localhost:3000/hello. This is automated routing based on page files.

## Docs

Next, let's touch on the powerful documentation system in Docusaurus.
Before that, kill your webserver (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>) and let's install [react-trend](https://github.com/unsplash/react-trend)

```bash
yarn add react-trend
```

Create a a new file `docs/hello.md` with below content

```md
---
title: Hello
---

I can write content using [GitHub-flavored Markdown syntax](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

import Trend from 'react-trend';

<Trend
  smooth
  autoDraw
  autoDrawDuration={3000}
  autoDrawEasing="ease-out"
  data={[0,2,5,9,5,10,3,5,0,0,1,8,2,9,0]}
  gradient={['#00c6ff', '#F0F', '#FF0']}
  radius={10}
  strokeWidth={2}
  strokeLinecap={'butt'}
/>


## Markdown Syntax

**Bold** _italic_ `code` [Links](#url)

> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse
> id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

* Hey
* Ho
* Let's Go
```


If you go to http://localhost:3000/docs/hello you can see a new page created from that markdown file. 

![Markdown](/img/markdown.PNG)

You can always edit the markdown file, save it and it will be hot reloaded. Did you notice that we just **imported a React component and embed it inside our markdown** :wink: ?

Next, let's add a sidebar to it

Create a `sidebars.json` file
```json
{
  "docs": {
    "Getting Started": [
      "hello"
    ]
  }
}
```

And edit your `docusaurus.config.js` presets to this

```js
// .... other code
  presets: [
    [
      "@docusaurus/preset-classic",
      {
        docs: {
          sidebarPath: require.resolve("./sidebars.json")
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
```

You can see that there is a sidebar now on http://localhost:3000/docs/hello

![docs](/img/docs.PNG)

## Blog

Another feature is the blogging system. Once again, I remind you that this blog is created with Docusaurus 2.

Now, let's create a new markdown file `blog/2018-05-16-hello.md`

```md
---
title: Hello
author: Endilie Y
authorTitle: Maintainer of Docusaurus
authorURL: https://github.com/endiliey
authorImageURL: https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17883920?s=460&v=4

---

Welcome to my blog. This blog is created with [**Docusaurus 2 alpha**](https://docusaurus-2.netlify.com/) :wink:

<!--truncate -->

More content here ....
```

If you navigate to http://localhost:3000/blog. You can see that we have a blog list page. You can also navigate to http://localhost:3000/blog/2019/05/16/hello

![blog](/img/blog.PNG)

## Theme

Users can install themes, that provide a set of components, e.g. `Navbar`, `Layout`, `Footer`. 

Users can use these components in their code by importing them using the `@theme` webpack alias:

```js
import Navbar from '@theme/Navbar';
```

The alias `@theme` can refer to a few directories, in the following priority:

1. A user's `website/theme` directory, which is a special directory that has the higher precedence.
1. A Docusaurus theme packages's `theme` directory.
1. Fallback components provided by Docusaurus core (usually not needed).

Given the following structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docusaurus-theme
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ theme
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Navbar.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ theme
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Navbar.js
```

`theme/Navbar.js` takes precedence whenever `@theme/Navbar` is imported. This behavior is called component swizzling. In iOS, method swizzling is the process of changing the implementation of an existing selector (method). In the context of a website, component swizzling will mean providing an alternative component that takes precedence over the theme-provided component.

The classic/default Docusaurus theme will provide most components out of the box, and users can swizzle the components by adding a component of the same name in the `themes` directory if they want to modify how it looks and behaves.

## Component Swizzling

You might notice that at first, we installed **`@docusaurus/preset-classic`**. Presets are collection of plugins and themes.

The basic overview of @docusaurus/preset-classic is this:

```md
preset-classic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ theme-classic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Navbar.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Layout.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Footer.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin-docs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ theme
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DocPage.js
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DocItem.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin-blog
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin-pages
```

So how do we swizzle the theme component easily ?

First of all, make sure to kill your webserver (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>) and run this command to swizzle (override) the component.

```bash
yarn swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Footer
```

It will create a `themes/Footer` file in your project folder.
Try to edit that file, save it and you can see that we're customizing the Footer.

For example, we can just return null for the Footer.:
```js
import React from 'react';

function Footer() {
  return null;
}

export default Footer;
```

And you can see that the footer is no longer shown. It's not the default Facebook footer anymore! :smile:

## Search

To add search bar with Algolia, just add algolia field in your themeConfig. Note that you will need algolia API key. You can use docusaurus 2's api key for testing purposes.

```js
// docusaurus.config.js
themeConfig: {
    // ....
    algolia: {
      apiKey: '47ecd3b21be71c5822571b9f59e52544',
      indexName: 'docusaurus-2',
      algoliaOptions: {},
    },
  },
```

Example:

![search](/img/search.png)

## Build

To build the website, just run this command. After that, check your **build** folder.

```bash
yarn build
```

You can deploy it to GitHub pages, netlify, etc. It's completely up to you. The site is server rendered so it works without JavaScript too !

## Deploy

Docusaurus provide a very easy way of publishing to GitHub pages.
First, you need to modify your `docusaurus.config.js` and add the required params


| Name               | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `organizationName` | The GitHub user or organization that owns the repository. If you are the owner, then it is your GitHub username. In the case of Docusaurus, that would be the "_facebook_" GitHub organization.                                                   |
| `projectName`      | The name of the GitHub repository for your project. For example, the source code for Docusaurus is hosted at https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus, so our project name in this case would be "docusaurus". |
| `url`              | Your website's URL. For projects hosted on GitHub pages, this will be "https://_username_.github.io" |
| `baseUrl`          | Base URL for your project. For projects hosted on GitHub pages, it follows the format "/_projectName_/". For https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus, `baseUrl` is `/docusaurus/`. |

Example:

```js
const siteConfig = {
  ...
  url: 'https://endiliey.github.io', // Your website URL
  baseUrl: '/',
  projectName: 'endiliey.github.io',
  organizationName: 'endiliey'
  ...
}
```

3. Now you have to specify the git user as an environment variable and run the deploy script

| Name       | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GIT_USER` | The username for a GitHub account that has commit access to this repo. For your own repositories, this will usually be your own GitHub username. The specified `GIT_USER` must have push access to the repository specified in the combination of `organizationName` and `projectName`. |

Example:

```bash
GIT_USER=endiliey yarn run deploy
```

There are also two optional parameters that are set as environment variables:

| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USE_SSH`        | If this is set to `true`, then SSH is used instead of HTTPS for the connection to the GitHub repo. HTTPS is the default if this variable is not set.                                                                                                              |
| `CURRENT_BRANCH` | The branch that contains the latest docs changes that will be deployed. Usually, the branch will be `master`, but it could be any branch (default or otherwise) except for `gh-pages`. If nothing is set for this variable, then the current branch will be used. |

This website for example, use TravisCI to automate running this deploy script.

## To be continued ....

There are lot of other undocumented features that I am not able to write in detail on this super short post, like [theme, plugin and presets](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/1438). There are also some killer features that we haven't implemented in v2 (but already did in v1) like i18n, and versioning. 

Anyway, that's all for now. I hope you enjoyed this super short guide.
